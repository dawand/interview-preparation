- Improving upon a design: Think about and review the complex systems you’ve already designed. What would you change about your approach if you did it all over again? What worked well?

- Designing from the ground up: Think about how you’d design a system that Facebook (Or Twitter, Google, Uber, Dropbox, etc) already has. It’s a good thought exercise to think through the complicated, high-scale systems that you already use every day. How would design it from the ground up?

- Blog Up: Read engineering blogs about approaches that work and false starts big companies have had along the way.
- Start with requirements: Your interviewer might ask: “How would you architect the backend for a messaging system?” Obviously this question is extremely vague. Where do you even start? You could start with some requirements:
 -- How many users are we talking about here?
 -- How many messages sent?
 -- How many messages read?
 -- What are the latency requirements for sender->receiver message delivery?
 -- How are you going to store messages?
 -- What operations does this data store need to support?
 -- What operations is it optimized for?
 -- How do you push new messages to clients? Do you push at all, or rely on a pull based model?
