#### Design pattern 
| Name      | Intent                 | Real world example | 
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------| 
| Builder   | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.  | java.lang.StringBuilder#append()/java.lang.StringBuffer#append | 
| Singleton | Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. | java.lang.Runtime#getRuntime() |
| Adapter   | Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. | java.util.Arrays#asList()/java.util.Collections#list() | 
| Flyweight | Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. | java.lang.Integer#valueOf(int) (also on Boolean, Byte, Character, Short, Long and BigDecimal) | 
| Command   | Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. | java.lang.Runnable |
| Iterator  | Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. | All implementations of java.util.Iterator (thus among others also java.util.Scanner)  | 
| Mediator  | Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently. |  java.util.Timer (all scheduleXXX() methods)/java.util.concurrent.Executor#execute()/java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke() | 
| Memento   | Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be returned to this state later.      | java.util.Date (the setter methods do that, Date is internally represented by a long value)/ All implementations of java.io.serializable/                                                                                                                             | 
| Strategy  | Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it. | java.util.Comparator#compare(), executed by among others Collections#sort   | 
| Template  | Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to client subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.   | All non-abstract methods of java.io.InputStream,java.io.OutputStream,java.io.Reader,java.io.Writer/All non-abstract methods of java.util.AbstractList, java.util.AbstractSet and java.util.AbstractMap |
