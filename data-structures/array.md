## Array 
### Circular array 
* Common techniques used in circular arrays
  - double the array to 2n by concatenating original array to the end and then apply a sliding window of size n on it (whether is a sorted rotated array)
  - invert the sign of the array (circular array maximum sum)
  - break the circle (house robber II)

### Array sum
* Array sum related questions can be divided into the following categories (see algorithm section for further details)
  - Two pointers
    + Begin and end type: Two sum II and variants (3Sum, 3Sum closest, 3Sum smaller)
    + Window type: Minimize size subarray sum
  - Hashmap
    + Two sum
    + Maximize size subarray sum equals K
  - Backtrack
    + Combination sum I/II/II
  - Dynamic programming
    + One sequence: maximum subarray
    + Backpack type: Combination sum IV
